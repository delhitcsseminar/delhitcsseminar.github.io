        Hardness of Approximation of k-Median and k-Means problem </a></span>
    <span class="date"> March 03, 2021 </span>
    <span class="speaker"> Dishant Goyal </span>
    <span class="abstract"> 
    	<p>In the k-median problem, we are given a set of clients C and a set of feasible facility locations L in a metric space (X,d). The task is to open a set F of 'k' facilities such that the total assignment cost of clients is minimized, i.e., minimize sum_{x in C} d(x,F), where d(x,F) denotes the distance of x to the closest facility location in F.</p>
		
		<p>The k-means problem is defined similarly where d(x,F) is replaced by the squared distance d^2(x,F). I will present the hardness of approximation results for both the problems in general metric spaces and lp-normed spaces. These results are based on the following two works: </p>

		1. Guha, S., & Khuller, S. "Greedy strikes back: improved facility location algorithms." [SODA 1998]<br/>
		
		2. Cohen-Addad, Vincent, and C. S. Karthik. "Inapproximability of clustering in lp metrics." [FOCS 2019]
 
		<p>The problem has another variant, where one is allowed to open a facility anywhere in a metric space, instead of just L. In this version, there could be an infinite number of feasible facility locations. For this variant, stronger inapproximability results are known. I will present the results that are based on the following work:</p>
 
		1. Cohen-Addad, Vincent, C. S. Karthik, and Euiwoong Lee. "On Approximability of Clustering Problems Without Candidate Centers." [SODA 2021]
 
		<p>The talk would be more like a survey with a simple description of some inapproximability results.</p>

				Constant Factor Approximation Algorithm for Uniform Hard Capacitated Knapsack Median Problem </a>
			</span>
			<span class="abstract">
				<p>
					In this paper, we give the first constant factor
					approximation algorithm for capacitated knapsack median problem (CKnM)
					for hard uniform capacities, violating the budget by a factor of ($1 +
					\epsilon$) and capacities by a ($2 + \epsilon$) factor. To the best of
					our knowledge, no constant factor approximation algorithm is known for
					the problem even with capacity/budget/both violations. Even for the
					uncapacitated variant of the problem, the natural LP is known to have
					an unbounded integrality gap. We also present two constant factor
					approximation algorithms for Capacitated k-Facility Location problem,
					with violation in capacity and/or cardinality, thus, presenting a
					trade-off in both violations. As a by-product, a constant factor
					approximation algorithm for capacitated facility location problem with
					uniform capacities is presented, violating the capacities by ($1 +
					\epsilon$) factor. Though constant factor results are known for the
					problem without violating the capacities, the result is interesting as
					it is obtained by rounding the solution to the natural LP, which is
					known to have an unbounded integrality gap without violating the
					capacities. Thus, we achieve the best possible from the natural LP for
					the problem.

        		Uniform Capacitated Facility Location Problems with Penalties/Outliers </a></span>
		    <span class="abstract">
		        <p>We present a framework to design approximation algorithms for capacitated facility location problems with penalties/outliers using LP-rounding.</p>

		        <p>We apply our framework to obtain first constant factor approximations for capacitated facility location problem with outlier (CFLPO) and capacitated $k$-facility location problem with penalty(C$k$FLPP) for hard uniform capacities using LP-rounding. Our solutions incur slight violations in capacities, ($1 + \epsilon$) for the problems without cardinality($k$) constraint and ($2 + \epsilon$) for the problems with the cardinality constraint. For the outlier variant, we also incur a small loss ($1 + \epsilon$) in outliers. Due to the hardness of the underlying problems, the violations are inevitable. Thus we achieve the best possible by rounding the solution of natural LP for these problems. To the best of our knowledge, no results are known for CFLPO and C$k$FLPP. </p>

		        <p>Our results are obtained by rounding the solution to the natural LP once again exhibiting the power of LP-rounding technique. Solutions obtained by LP-rounding are easy to integrate with other LP-based algorithms.   </p>

			<span class="abstract">
				<p>Graph compression or sparsification is a basic information-theoretic and computational question of the following nature: given a graph G, can we compute a “compact” representation of G, with potentially fewer vertices or edges, that preserves important information? Such objects play a major role in the design of efficient graph algorithms and thus have been a center of study for decades. For instance, the notion of graph spanners aim to preserve the distance between nodes in the graphs while reducing the number of edges, while the notion of vertex sparsification focuses on preserving some properties of the designated nodes such as connectivity, cut sizes, or effective resistances. In this talk, I shall mostly do a survey of some recent developments in vertex sparsification of graphs. The talk would be mostly based on the following papers.<br>

        Improved Approximations for Min Sum Vertex Cover and Generalized Min Sum Set Cover </a></span>
    <span class="abstract">
        <p>We study the generalized min sum set cover (GMSSC) problem, wherein given a collection of hyperedges E with arbitrary covering requirements k_e, the goal is to find an ordering of the vertices to minimize the total cover time of the hyperedges; a hyperedge e is considered covered by the first time when k_e many of its vertices appear in the ordering. We give a 4.642 approximation algorithm for GMSSC, coming close to the best possible bound of 4, already for the classical special case (with all k_e=1) of min sum set cover (MSSC) studied by Feige, Lovász and Tetali, and improving upon the previous best known bound of 12.4 due to Im, Sviridenko and van der Zwaan. Our algorithm is based on transforming the LP solution by a suitable kernel and applying randomized rounding. This also gives an LP-based 4 approximation for MSSC. As part of the analysis of our algorithm, we also derive an inequality on the lower tail of a sum of independent Bernoulli random variables, which might be of independent interest and broader utility.</p>

        <p>Another well-known special case is the min sum vertex cover (MSVC) problem, in which the input hypergraph is a graph and k_e=1, for every edge. We give a 16/9 approximation for MSVC, and show a matching integrality gap for the natural LP relaxation. This improves upon the previous best 1.999946 approximation of Barenholz, Feige and Peleg. (The claimed 1.79 approximation result of Iwata, Tetali and Tripathi for the MSVC turned out have an unfortunate, seemingly unfixable, mistake in it.) Finally, we revisit MSSC and consider the ell_p norm of cover-time of the hyperedges. Using a dual fitting argument, we show that the natural greedy algorithm achieves tight, up to NP-hardness, approximation guarantees of (p+1)^{1+1/p}, for all p>=1. For p=1, this gives yet another proof of the 4 approximation for MSSC. </p>

        Time-Space Tradeoffs for Function Inversion </a></span>
    <span class="abstract">
        One-way functions - functions that can be evaluated easily on any input, but are hard to invert - are one of the fundamental building blocks of cryptography. In this talk, we will discuss the following question : given a function f, how hard/easy is it to invert y = f(x) if we're allowed unbounded preprocessing (before receiving y). More formally, we will work in the oracle setting. An adversary is first given (unbounded) oracle access to the function f to produce an S bit state. After this preprocessing, it is given f(x) (for a random x). Now, how many further oracle calls to f are necessary/sufficient to invert f(x)?  <br><br>

        We will discuss (a subset of) the following results:<br> 
        - Yao's lower bound [1]: For functions with domain [N], if S bits are produced during preprocessing, and T oracle calls are required in the online phase, then S.T must be at least N. <br>
        - Hellman/Fiat-Naor's upper bound[2,3] - One can invert f(x) using T oracle calls and S bits of preprocessing advice if S^3.T is about N^3. In particular, T = S = N^{0.75} is enough to invert. <br>
        - Is it possible to improve the lower bound? Corrigan-Gibbs, Kogan, in a recent work [4], showed that this would imply new circuit lower bounds (and hence is believed to be hard). <br>
        - Finally, in the last part of the talk, I will discuss the scenario where the adversary is allowed to be quantum, and even the preprocessing based advice could be quantum. (I will try to ensure that no quantum background is required. In any case, this will only be the last ten/fifteen minutes). For this, I will discuss the results from two works by Nayebi et al [5] and Chung et al [6].  <br><br>
